Accuracy questions exist; 
1) Continuity of grid refinement; possible solution is to avoid island adaptation; if it is the only cell to be adapted avoid; not for boundary cells; (check north - south , east - west independently; also if it is the only cell not to be adapted - refine it as well. 
2) Criteria; vorticity is not giving good performance;
3) Coarsening algorithm needs to be there; 
4) FOU is not giving good performance; 
5) Time step needs to be arranged.  



OLD!!!!
Try keeping facelist attached to Vertex
Refine addFace

****** Tried weak_ptr; but it is extremely inefficient;*********
grid keeps track of nearest vertex to a vertex; that's best; 
***** IMPORTANT ***** 
Everyting in Vertex and Cell, ngbr etc. should be maintained as
integers; and shared_ptr should be accessed through get methods

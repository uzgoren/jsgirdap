@17-08-2016: EU : Reconfiguring directory structure and cmake; so that static library is produced. Then the command line to link it is as follows:
          g++ -o test main_div.cpp ../girdap/lib/libgirdap.a -I ../girdap/include -std=c++11

@11-20-2015: EU : Internal corner cells are not yet supported (see Vertex.cpp)
                  Boundary cells are defined for only quad in Vertex.cpp
                  -- This can be extended through a new virtual function (in Cells)
@2-2-2016: EU : * Grid coarsening algorithm with master cell approach is 
                  working with some exceptions (needs to be investigated)
                * Level set (vortex stretching) is now producing better results
